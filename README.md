The project involves using MQ3 and DHT11 sensors connected to Arduino for
 real-time data collection.
 • Data is transmitted to the cloud for visualization, enabling farmers to make 
data-driven irrigation decisions.
 • Additionally, control mechanisms can be implemented to mitigate the need of 
resources based on the collected data.
